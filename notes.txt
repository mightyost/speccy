Flags:

When performing a sum:

- Sign is always set to bit 7 of the result
- Zero is set if the result is 0x00
- Half-carry is set when the right nibble sum of the operands overflows
- Overflow is set when both operands are positive and signed sum is negative or both operands are negative and the signed sum is positive
- Add/Sub is reset
- Carry is set if the unsigned sum overflows 0xFF


Half-carry flag:

FLAG = (A^B^RESULT)&0x10  for any operation

Overflow flag:

FLAG = ~(A^B)&(B^RESULT)&0x80 for addition [ADD/ADC]
FLAG = (A^B)&(A^RESULT)&0x80  for subtraction [SUB/SBC]

For INC/DEC, you can use following simplifications:

INC:
H_FLAG = (RESULT&0x0F)==0x00
V_FLAG = RESULT==0x80

DEC:
H_FLAG = (RESULT&0x0F)==0x0F
V_FLAG = RESULT==0x7F
